# Custom eslint rules in typescript monorepo

An example of how to run eslint rules written in typescript within normal eslint check.

There is an example of custom eslint rule in `packages` that is written in typescript.
It enforces that all variables should have the same "bla" name :)

Install dependencies and run eslint to see it in action.

```
yarn install

yarn lint
```
